# chessGame-python
A simple chess game with following rules:
● Player 1 moves first. 
● Pawns can move forward, right and left one space to an empty location, or diagonally one space to capture an opponent’s pawn at that location. 
● A pawn must capture an opponent’s pawn if a capturing move is available. 
● On any capturing move, the player immediately moves again with another pawn that has not yet moved that turn. 
● The first player to get a pawn to the opposite end of the board wins.
